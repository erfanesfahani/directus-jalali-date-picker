# Custom Jalali Date Picker Interface for Directus

This interface allows users to select dates in the Jalali (Persian) calendar format while storing and sending the date as the Gregorian calendar format. This is perfect for users in regions where the Persian calendar is commonly used, but still need to work with the widely accepted Gregorian calendar in backend systems.

## Features
- **Jalali Calendar Display**: Users can select their desired date using the Persian calendar.
- **Gregorian Date Submission**: Despite the displayed Jalali date, the form submission sends the corresponding Gregorian date to the server.

## Installation Guide

To set up and use the Custom Jalali Date Picker interface, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository to the `extensions` folder in your Directus project.
   - Navigate to the `extensions` directory in your Directus project and clone the repository.

### 3. Build the Interface
   - After the dependencies are installed, run the build command to generate the necessary files:

### 4. Enjoy Jalali Date Picker! ðŸŽ‰ ;)
